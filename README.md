# Advanced Business Applications Programming with Python

Welcome to the course repository for Advanced Business Applications Programming! This repository contains all the materials you'll need for our Python programming course.

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth introduction to the Python language, helping you master its fundamentals and apply them to solve business problems. By the end of this course, you'll be proficient in:

- Implementing decision-making structures
- Using repetition structures
- Creating and using functions
- Web scraping
- Database connections
- Testing and debugging
- Using NumPy and Pandas for data analysis
- Handling various data formats

## Repository Structure

I use Git branches to organize the course content by topics. This allows for easier management and navigation of the course materials.

### Main Branch Contents

The `main` branch (current branch) serves as the central hub for course-wide materials and information. It contains:

- README.md (this file)
- syllabus.md
- requirements.txt
- course_outline.md

### Topic Branches

Each major topic has its own branch containing topic-specific content. Topic branches are named with the prefix `topic/`.


### Playground Branch

We have a special `playground` branch for experimentation and testing. This branch is used for:
- Trying out new Python concepts
- Testing code snippets
- Experimenting with ideas before implementing them in the main course content
- Creating temporary examples for students

When using the playground branch, feel free to create, modify, or delete files as needed. Changes in this branch won't affect the main course content or topic branches.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start by reviewing the materials in the `main` branch.
2. For each topic, check out the corresponding topic branch:
   - In PyCharm, go to Git > Branches (or simply use the CLI)
   - Choose the topic branch you want to work on
3. Always refer back to the `main` branch for course-wide information and resources.
4. When working in the playground branch:
   - Switch to the `playground` branch
   - Experiment freely with code and ideas
   - Remember that content here is temporary and for testing purposes only

## Stay Updated

As we progress through the course, new topic branches will be added. To get the latest content:

1. Fetch all branches:
   - In PyCharm, go to Git > Fetch
2. Check out the desired topic branch:
   - Go to Git > Branches and select the topic you want

 Happy coding!
