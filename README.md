# Advanced Business Applications Programming with Python

Welcome to the course repository for Advanced Business Applications Programming! This repository contains all the materials you'll need for our Python programming course.

## Course Overview

This course provides an in-depth introduction to the Python language, helping you master its fundamentals and apply them to solve business problems. By the end of this course, you'll be proficient in:

- Implementing decision-making structures
- Using repetition structures
- Creating and using functions
- Web scraping
- Database connections
- Testing and debugging
- Using NumPy and Pandas for data analysis
- Handling various data formats

## Repository Structure

I use Git branches to organize the course content by topics. This allows for easier management and navigation of the course materials.

### Main Branch Contents

The `main` branch (current branch) serves as the central hub for course-wide materials and information. It contains:

- README.md (this file)
- syllabus.md
- requirements.txt
- course_outline.md

### Topic Branches

Each major topic has its own branch containing topic-specific content. Topic branches are named with the prefix `topic/`.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start by reviewing the materials in the `main` branch.
2. For each topic, check out the corresponding topic branch:
   - In PyCharm, go to Git > Branches (or simply use the CLI)
   - Choose the topic branch you want to work on
3. Always refer back to the `main` branch for course-wide information and resources.

## Stay Updated

As we progress through the course, new topic branches will be added. To get the latest content:

1. Fetch all branches:
   - In PyCharm, go to Git > Fetch
2. Check out the desired topic branch:
   - Go to Git > Branches and select the topic you want

 Happy coding!
